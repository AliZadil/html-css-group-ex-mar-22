We will be reusing project files from last time.

Start by editing the **index.html** and **style.css** files in this repo. Add the style code at the end of the style.css file.

Add a style in style.css that:
 - adds a border to the section tag. Use id="main-section" for the section css selector.
 - adds padding 20 pixels to the section tag
Apply this same style to the unordered list in the page. Use a class for this.

Add a style for h1, h2, h3, that:
 - adds a red border to them
 - aligns text to center

Add a style to the list items in the unordered list, that:
 - moves them 40 pixels to the right;
 - styles the links so they aren't underlined anymore
 - hides the cursor when user hovers on them

Add a div before the end of the section;
 - add two span tags inside this div, with text "Test text 1" and "Test text 2"
 - look at how they are displayed, before applying the next style.
  - change the display of these span tags to display block. How did they change?

Add a div before the end of the section;
 - add two div tags inside this div, with text "Div content 1" and "Div content 2"
 - change the height and width of the div blocks. What changed? 
 - look at how they are displayed, before applying the next style.
  - change the display of these div tags to display inline. How did they change?
  - change the height again, to double the size. How did they change now?

Add a br and a button with text "Finish" before the end of the section tag.
 - style the button so that it's twice as big, and rotated 90 degrees. Hint: use transform translate
